== Mpbuildserver

Mpbuildserver watches the MacPorts source repository for changes and
builds changed ports inside of a chroot environment, possibly posting
build results to Portmill[1] web application, to store them and make
them searchable and browsable.

== Dependencies

Mpbuildserver relies on ruby 1.8 and these libraries:

- mpab -- MacPorts AutoBuild, an environment for building a MacPorts
  and installing ports in a chroot environment. Part of the MacPorts
  contrib collection[2].
- json gem / rubyforge.com
- rest-client gem / rubyforge.com
- febeling-couch_potato gem / gems.github.com

== Usage

A typical invokation looks like this:

  sudo ./bin/mpbuildserver -v \
           -c -i 180 \
           -m ../../vendor/mp-contrib/mpab \
           -s http://portmill.florianebeling.com/builds/create 

This assumes a Portmill application running
