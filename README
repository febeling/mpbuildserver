== Mpbuildserver

Mpbuildserver watches the MacPorts source repository for changes and
builds changed ports inside of a chroot environment, possibly posting
build results to Portmill[1] web application, to store them and make
them searchable and browsable. It wraps around MacPorts AutoBuild
(MPAB) by Bryan Blackburn to create the chroot environment and do the
actual building.

== Dependencies

Mpbuildserver relies on ruby 1.8 and these libraries:

- mpab -- for building a MacPorts and installing ports in a chroot
  environment. Part of the MacPorts contrib collection[2].

- json gem / rubyforge.com

- rest-client gem / rubyforge.com

- open4 gem / rubyforge.com

== Usage

A typical invokation looks like this:

  sudo ./bin/mpbuildserver -v \
           -c -i 180 \
           -m ../../vendor/mp-contrib/mpab \
           -s http://storageserver.mydomain.com/

This assumes a Portmill application running at the indicated URL.

== Development

To run the tests type:

  rake test
